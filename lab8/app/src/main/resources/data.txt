The Nightingale

	With courage, grace and powerful insight, bestselling author Kristin Hannah
captures the epic panorama of World War II and illuminates an intimate part
of history seldom seen: the women's war. The Nightingale tells the stories
of two sisters, separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion and
circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love,
and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France.

The Da Vinci Code
	Langdon made his way through the low archway and felt the cool dampness of 
the cellar. The floor sloped down steeply, and as his eyes grew more accusto-
med to the dim light, he could see a series of shadowy shelves on either side 
of him. <CR>
	The words Saunière had left for him echoed in his mind.<CR>
	Robert,<CR>
	Find the keystone.<CR>
	Then he is dead.<CR>
	Now you know too much.<CR>
	With a growing sense of unease, Langdon made his way down the stone steps. 
At the bottom, he paused and let his eyes adjust to the darkness. The air was 
heavy with the smell of musty old books.<CR>
	The keystone. Langdon tried to imagine what Saunière could have meant. The 
stone that unlocks the door? A stone with a key carved into it? A stone shaped 
like a key? A key-shaped stone?<CR>
	Langdon knew he was grasping at straws. He had never heard of any such 
thing. The Priory of Sion may have hidden the Holy Grail, but if they had hidden 
a keystone, it had eluded the world for centuries.<CR>
	With a deep breath, Langdon began walking down the main aisle, his hand 
gliding over the spine of each book. The faint light was coming from somewhere 
up ahead, and as he moved closer, he saw the outline of a large wooden door.<CR>
	Langdon quickened his pace, his eyes fixed on the door. The sooner he found 
this keystone, the better. He could feel the weight of the stone in his pocket, 
the stone that had brought him to Paris, that had brought him to Sophie. A sudden 
longing for her swept over him.<CR>
	Sophie. If he could just find this damn keystone, he might be able to help 
her? She was still out there somewhere, running for her life. He thought about 
the last time he had seen her, standing alone in the Louvre's Grand Gallery. 
The way she had looked at him. The way he had felt.<CR>
	Langdon reached the door and pushed it open. The room beyond was barely lit, 
and for a moment, he could see nothing at all. But then he heard the sound.
	It was faint, almost imperceptible. But he heard it nonetheless.<CR>
	The sound of someone breathing.<CR>

The Forbidden Forest
	Harry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been running. 
He had never in all his life felt so utterly miserable. Ron and Hermione's voices 
sounded distant and muffled. He could see the silhouettes of Fang, Hagrid's 
boarhound, and the centaur, Bane, standing over him.<CR>
	Then, from far away, above his head, he heard a new sound. It was a man's 
voice, but rich and deep, with an odd, musical lilt. It was familiar.<CR>
	Dumbledore's.<CR>
